I study...
  - Fisheries assessment and management

  - Predictive modeling
  
Using ...
  - Bayesian methods
  - Econometrics
  - Simulation modeling
  - Open and reproducible data science
  - Collaboration

# An Optimistic Skeptic



### The skeptic... 

Someday I hope for a clear answer...

--

  - But it hasn't happened yet. 
  
  - Complex systems often resist simple solutions

--

### The optimism...

- There are lessons in null-results

- Science can help us navigate uncertainty and complexity

- Slow progress towards better understanding and better outcomes


???

What do I mean by an optimistic skeptic? Social-ecological systems are complicated. This both complicates our ability to clearly understand what is happening in them, and to identify simple solutions to complex problems. Hence, "skeptic": my prior is that uncertainty and complexity are the norm. Optimist though: I believe that science can help us navigate this uncertainty and complexity in a productive way, to help us move slowly towards better understanding and better outcomes.

# Why Bayes?

Bayesian methods... 
  - Allow us estimate **probabilities** around parameters and policy effects
  
  - Give us a framework for incorporating **prior knowledge**
  
  - Lend themselves to the **complex structure** of social-ecological systems

Two general options

  1. Conduct fishery-independent surveys
    - Research trawls, acoustics, visual surveys, etc.
    - Accurate (hopefully) but expensive
    
  2. Depend on data from the fishery
    - Fisheries captures
    - Catch-per-unit-effort
    - Cheaper but often biased


---

# How many fish can we catch?

Suppose we conduct a survey and find that there are 100,000 fish in the population...

--
  
  - Does this represent a large fraction of a small but unfished population?
  
  - A small fraction of a historically massive population?
  
--

Which is right has major implications for management. 

To answer this, we use a class of models broadly called *stock assessments*


---


# Stock Assessments

.pull-left[
Ideally, stock assessments fit a *population dynamics* model
    
  - Births
  - Deaths
  - Growth


using  *fishery dependent* and *independent* data

  - Catches and catch per unit effort
  - Size & age structure
  - Research surveys
  
These models estimate *stock status* relative to *reference points*
  - Unfished biomass
  - Biomass that would maximize long-term catch
  - Sustainability of fishing effort

# A Tale of Two Fisheries

Stock assessments provide best estimates of the state of fisheries providing ~ 50% of the world's catch.

# Anatomy of a Catch-Only Model

.pull-left[

Given a catch history and a population model...

1. Construct **prior distributions** of parameters
  - growth rate, carrying capacity, initial and final stock status
  
2. Sample parameters from prior distributions and apply to catch history + model

3. **reject** combinations of parameters that crash the population or **don't conform to status priors**

# How well do catch-only models work?

And can we make them better?

.pull-left[

- Catch-only models increasingly being used to assess and manage fisheries

- Many models, but share common feature of **inferring** or **predicting** stock status based on attributes of **catch history**

- Vigorous debate around performance

# [`sraplus`](https://danovando.github.io/sraplus/)

Pella-Tomlinson surplus production model with process error



$$B_{t + 1} = \left(B_{t} + B_{t}\frac{r}{m - 1}\left(1 - \left(\frac{B_t}{K}\right)^{m- 1}\right) - c_t\right)p_t$$
$$log(p_t) \sim {N}\left(-\sigma_{proc}^2/2,\sigma_{proc}\right)$$

Can... 
  - Run as a catch-only model
  - Incorporate subjective or empirical priors on stock status
  - Fit to abundance index if available

- We can't **infer** stock status based on catch alone

  - Effort reconstructions
  - Strength of fisheries management
  - Intensity of trawling
  
  
- Using `sraplus`, we tested the ability of different combinatinos of other **broadly available** data to say something useful about the status of fisheries

# Evaluating Protected Areas

Ecosystem-based management increasingly asked to meet needs of environment and society. 


There is a growing push to protect 30% of land and water in the coming decade.

One strategy for providing "whole ecosystem" protection: reserves


Social-ecological systems are highly complex though
  - Spatial-temporal dynamics
  - Species interactions
  - Human behavior
  

---

# Leaving the Walled Garden

.pull-left[

- Early protected areas focused on providing refuge from the outside world

- Modern protected areas increasingly intended to benefit **outside**

- Particularly in the marine realm
  - Commonly called **marine protected areas**
  - Highly mobile species
  - Importance of wild fisheries

].pull-right[

---

# Population-Level Effects of Protected Areas

.pull-left[

- Protected area research historically focused on **inside** vs. **outside**

- Protection has wider impacts though
  - "spillover" of adult or larval organisms
  - Displacement of human activities 

- This spillover both allows MPAs to provide wider benefits, but also poses major challenges.

# constance notes

summarize the problem with catch only quicker

what's the key thing from each slide

more people - impacts of not having assessments

remind people that it's the same area

was the blue line the result of the calculation 

# Tim Notes

figure out what you're trying to sell yourself as a bit more explicitly 

I'm a person that does blank - they're going to have 4 great talks
  - want people to get excited about specific things
  
Finding that sliver of positivitiy 

now what - where does the field go, where is my role in that

Can make the "tale of two fisheries" infinitely more simply. "important and hard"

Lead up to the big slide - get rid of B/BMSY

quick and then let the talk explain the optimistic skeptic. OK, so what does my optimistic skepticism 

Spending a bit of time for the terrestrial folks about why (stock assessment) is challenging 

prior and posterior explanations - set up expectation, and then the result

- dig into the abundance estimates 

Competing with slides too much - when do you want attention on you and when you want it on - reserves in the marine protected areas 

great for the department because of blank

Kareiva around them lies "the qusetion" try to figure out the big question about you. Tim, are you too siilar to so and so. Am I going to be field work enough, where's your big three 

Take bathroom breaks, no space in between 

take the time for the grad students - you try and learn about them

intrepid

someday I hope to find a nice and clear thing, but the hard ones are important
